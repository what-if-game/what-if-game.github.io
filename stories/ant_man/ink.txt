Your day starts with the usual struggle; the world seems to tilt ever more against you. Despite your efforts to turn over a new leaf, your criminal record casts a long shadow, hindering your attempts to secure a stable job. The weight of your past decisions presses down, making the future look bleak and your options limited. You're a thief at heart, but a well-meaning one, who now finds himself at a crossroads. The desire to do right by your daughter, to provide for her and secure visitation rights, clashes with the hard reality of your situation. Without a job, making ends meet is a constant battle, a challenge that demands a solution, one way or another.

As the day progresses, the dilemma sharpens. The possibility of joining your friend Luis' crew for a burglary tempts you with the promise of quick money. On the other hand, the path of seeking legal employment, despite your criminal record, whispers the chance of a different, maybe even a better life. The choices stand starkly before you, each radiating its own potential consequences and rewards.

Swept up by the thrill and perhaps, the necessity, you decide to join Luis and his crew for one last score that promises to solve all your problems. The target? Just a seemingly inconsequential house with a rumored safe filled with valuables. The plan goes off without a hitch, until you find yourself standing before the safe's contents, where, instead of cash or jewels, an old motorcycle suit catches your eye. Your curiosity piqued, you can't help but take it, not realizing the consequences this impulsive act will bring.

That night, driven by a pang of conscience and a dose of reality about the legality of your actions, you attempt to return the suit to its rightful home. But fate seems to have other plans. Before you can so much as set foot on the property, flashing red and blue lights ensnare you, leading to your immediate capture by the authorities. The suit, it turns out, was far more than a simple collector's item; it was a highly sought-after piece of technology.

Now, behind bars and reflecting on the series of unfortunate choices that led you here, you recognize the gravity of your current situation. With a criminal record already a heavy burden on your shoulders, any additional charges could sever the already tenuous ties you have left with your old life, not to mention the future you’ve been desperately trying to rebuild. The goal is clear: you need to escape this cage before it becomes a permanent fixture of your life's landscape, but how you achieve this freedom is a crossroads fraught with moral and legal peril.
