      { char_name: "T'Challa",
        story_name: "Black Panther",
        plot: `Centuries ago, five African tribes war over a meteorite containing Vibranium. One warrior ingests a "heart-shaped herb" affected by the metal and gains superhuman abilities, becoming the first "Black Panther". He unites all but the Jabari Tribe to form the nation of Wakanda. The Wakandans use the Vibranium to develop advanced technology and isolate themselves from the world by posing as a Third World country. The erected a camouflage energy shield around their country. The Jabari tribe lived in the mountains ever since.
In 1992, King T'Chaka (Atandwa) visits his brother N'Jobu (Sterling K. Brown), who is working undercover in Oakland, California. T'Chaka accuses N'Jobu of assisting black-market arms dealer Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) (A South African black-market arms dealer, smuggler and gangster, who is allied with Killmonger. He uses a piece of advanced Wakandan mining equipment as a sonic Disruptor arm-cannon, replacing his left arm, which he lost in Avengers: Age of Ultron) with stealing Vibranium from Wakanda. Klaue stole 0.25 tons of Vibranium and knew exactly where it was stored and how to get it out of Wakanda. N'Jobu's partner reveals he is Zuri (Forest Whitaker) (An elder statesman in Wakanda, and the keeper of the heart-shaped herb), another undercover Wakandan, and confirms T'Chaka's suspicions. N'Jobu is ordered to return to Wakanda and face punishment for his crimes.
In the present day, following T'Chaka's death, his son T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) (The king of the African nation of Wakanda, who gains enhanced strength by ingesting the Heart-Shaped Herb. After the events of Captain America: Civil War, and the death of his father T'Chaka, T'Challa is in mourning while ascending to the throne) returns to Wakanda to assume the throne.
He and Okoye (Danai Gurira) (An "extremely proud" Wakandan and traditionalist from the Border Tribe, who is the head of the Dora Milaje, the all-female special forces of Wakanda, who serve as T'Challa's bodyguards), the leader of the Dora Milaje regiment, extract Nakia (Lupita Nyong'O), T'Challa's ex-lover, from an undercover assignment (against an organized group of Nigerian women-traffickers) so she can attend his coronation ceremony with his mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett) and younger sister Shuri (Letitia Wright) (T'Challa's 16-year-old sister and the princess of Wakanda who designs new technology for the country).
At the ceremony, the Jabari Tribe's leader M'Baku (Winston Duke) (A powerful, ruthless warrior who is the leader of Wakanda's mountain tribe, the Jabari, who are in protest to T'Challa being the new king) challenges T'Challa for the crown in ritual combat. T'Challa defeats M'Baku and persuades him to yield rather than die. That night T'Challa is given a mix made up of the heart shaped herbs to give him powers of the Black Panther. The herb connects the soul to the Astral plane, where T'Challa is able to meet the soul of his father T'Chaka. Nakia wants Wakanda to help the needy around the world, but T'Challa wants to protect Wakanda's secrets and technology.
After Klaue and Erik Stevens (Michael B. Jordan) (The son of N'Jobu, and a U.S. black-ops soldier who seeks to overthrow his cousin T'Challa) steal a Wakandan artifact from a London Museum.
Okoye gets intelligence reports that Klaue plans to sell the Vibranium from the artifact to an American buyer in South Korea, in one day's time. W'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya), T'Challa's friend and Okoye's lover, urges him to bring Klaue back dead or alive. Shuri designs a new Black Panther suit for T'Challa. The suit absorbs kinetic energy and then holds it in place for redistribution. T'Challa, Okoye, and Nakia travel to an underground casino in Busan, South Korea, where Klaue plans to sell the artifact to CIA agent Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman). A firefight erupts and Klaue attempts to flee but is caught by T'Challa after a lengthy chase through Busan. T'Challa reluctantly releases him to Ross' custody.
Klaue tells Ross that Wakanda's international image of a poor third world country is a front for a technologically advanced civilization. Klaue says that he is the only outside who has ever seen the Wakanda Vibranium mine, and there is a whole mountain of it. Erik attacks and extracts Klaue (He tracks Klaue from the energy signature from Klaue's arm cannon which is powered by Vibranium) as Ross is gravely injured protecting Nakia. Rather than pursue Klaue, T'Challa takes Ross to Wakanda, where their technology can save him. Erik gets back to normal in a day, and witnesses the true extent of Wakandan technology.
While Shuri heals Ross, T'Challa confronts Zuri about N'Jobu. Zuri explains that N'Jobu planned to share Wakanda's technology with people of African descent around the world to help them conquer their oppressors. N'Jobu then wanted Wakanda to rule all countries in the world since Wakanda would control the supply of Vibranium. As T'Chaka arrested N'Jobu, N'Jobu attacked Zuri, forcing T'Chaka to kill him. T'Chaka ordered Zuri to lie that N'Jobu had disappeared and left behind N'Jobu's American son, Erik, in order to maintain the lie that N'Jobu was nowhere to be found. Erik became a U.S. black ops soldier, adopting the name "Killmonger". In reality Erik has a claim to the throne as well, since he is of royal blood.
Meanwhile, Killmonger kills Klaue and takes his body to Wakanda. He is brought before the tribal elders, revealing his identity and claim to the throne. Killmonger challenges T'Challa to ritual combat; after killing Zuri, he defeats T'Challa and hurls him over a waterfall. After ingesting the heart-shaped herb, Killmonger orders the rest incinerated, but Nakia extracts one first. Killmonger, supported by W'Kabi and his army, prepares to distribute shipments of Wakandan weapons to operatives around the world.
Nakia, Shuri, Ramonda and Ross flee to the Jabari Tribe for aid. They find a comatose T'Challa, rescued by the Jabari in repayment for sparing M'Baku's life. Healed by Nakia's herb, T'Challa returns to fight Killmonger, who dons his own Black Panther suit and commands W'Kabi and his army to attack T'Challa. Shuri, Nakia, and the Dora Milaje join T'Challa, while Ross remotely pilots a jet and shoots down the planes carrying the Vibranium weapons. M'Baku and the Jabari arrive to reinforce T'Challa. Confronted by Okoye, W'Kabi and his army stand down. Fighting in Wakanda's Vibranium mine, T'Challa disrupts Killmonger's suit and stabs him. Killmonger refuses to be healed, choosing to die a free man rather than be incarcerated.
T'Challa establishes an outreach center at the building where N'Jobu died to be run by Nakia and Shuri. In a mid-credits scene, T'Challa appears before the United Nations to reveal Wakanda's true nature to the world. In a post-credits scene, Shuri helps Bucky Barnes with his recuperation`},
      { char_name: "Stephen Strange",
        story_name: "Doctor Strange",
        plot: `In Kathmandu, Nepal, the sorcerer Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) and his zealots enter the secret compound Kamar-Taj and behead its librarian. From the ancient and mystical texts, they steal a ritual from a book belonging to the Ancient One, a sorcerer who has lived for an unknown time and taught all at Kamar-Taj, including Kaecilius, in the ways of the mystic arts. The Ancient One pursues the traitors, and traps Kaecilius in a mirror dimension. But Kaecilius escapes with the pages and some of his followers by opening up a portal out of the mirror dimension.
Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), an acclaimed neurosurgeon, loses the use of his hands in a car accident. Strange was very proud of his skill, which he had gained after several years of studies and practice. Strange considered himself to be a student of science and had extremely steady hands which allowed him to conduct the most difficult cranial surgeries with utmost precision. After the accident, his surgery required 11 surgical pins to be inserted into his bones and massive nerve damage in both hands. His operation lasted for 11 hours. The recovery is slow and there is still massive tissue damage.
Fellow surgeon and former lover Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) tries to help him move on, but Strange, firmly believing he can regain use of his hands, instead uses all his resources pursuing experimental surgeries. Strange submits himself to experimental procedures to help speed up the recovery process, but he cannot gain back any meaningful strength in his hands. World's leading experts give up on Strange.
Strange learns from his physiotherapist that there was one case in his career, who was paralyzed from the waste down and after a few years he saw the man walking by him on the street. Strange challenges the physiotherapist to fetch the medical file on the person. After learning of Jonathan Pangborn (Benjamin Bratt), a paraplegic who mysteriously was able to walk again, Strange seeks him out. Pangborn came back from a place from where he was not supposed to. Pangborn says that he even came to meet Strange and Strange refused to see him, as the best doctors do not take on hopeless cases to protect their reputation. Strange begs Pangborn and is directed to Kamar-Taj. Jonathan tells strange that he had given up on his body, but in the presence of his guru, he trained his own mind, and thereby healed his body.
In Kathmandu, Strange looks for Kamar-Taj for many weeks. Strange is taken in by another sorcerer under the Ancient One, Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor). The Ancient One says that the spirit of the body can program the cells to self-heal. Naturally, Strange is skeptical and even dismissive of The Ancient One. She compares him to a glass that is already full and hence cannot learn anymore. The Ancient One shows Strange her power, revealing the astral plane and other dimensions such as the Mirror Dimension. She says that the Universe is only one of an Infinite number, and at the root of reality, mind and matter meet. Some Universes are benign and give life, while others are full of hunger and contain evil forces which are older than time itself. Amazed, Strange begs her to teach him, and she eventually agrees despite his arrogance, which reminds her of Kaecilius. Mordo convinces The Ancient One that Kamar-Taj might need a person like Strange if Kaecilius manages to decode the stolen pages and summon the Dark forces.
Strange begins his tutelage under the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) and Mordo, and learns from the ancient books in the library, now presided over by the master Wong (Benedict Wong). He learns to harness energy from the infinite multiverses to power spells that create shields and weapons. Strange learns that Earth is protected from other dimensions by a spell formed from three buildings called Sanctums, found in New York City, London, and Hong Kong. The task of the sorcerers is to protect the Sanctums, though Pangborn chose to forgo this responsibility in favor of channeling mystical energy into walking again. Wong tells Strange about Dormammu, the supreme being of the Dark Dimension, who invades Universes, and bring them into his Dark Dimension. Dormammu is a being of infinite power and endless hunger. He hungers for Earth most of all. The ritual that Kaecilius stole was to contact Dormammu and to summon him from the Dark Dimension.
Strange advances quickly over several months, even secretly reading from the text Kaecilius stole from and learning to bend time with the mystical Eye of Agamotto. Mordo and Wong warn Strange against breaking the laws of nature, comparing his arrogant yearning for power to that of Kaecilius, who believes, after the deaths of his loved ones, that everyone should have eternal life.
Kaecilius and his followers use the stolen pages to begin summoning the powerful Dormammu of the Dark Dimension, where time does not exist, and all can live forever. This destroys the London Sanctum and sends Strange from Kamar-Taj to the New York Sanctum. The zealots then attack there, where Strange holds them off with the mystical Cloak of Levitation until Mordo and the Ancient One arrive.
Strange and Mordo become disillusioned with the Ancient One after Kaecilius reveals that her long life has come from her own use of Dormammu's power. Kaecilius mortally wounds the Ancient One, and escapes to Hong Kong. The Ancient One tells Strange that he, too, will have to break the rules, to balance Mordo's steadfast nature. She then dies, despite the best efforts of Strange and a bewildered Palmer.
Strange and Mordo arrive in Hong Kong to find Wong dead and the Sanctum destroyed, with the Dark Dimension already engulfing Earth. Strange uses the Eye to turn back time and save Wong, before creating an infinite time loop inside the Dark Dimension that traps himself and Dormammu in the same moment forever. After killing Strange many times to no avail, Dormammu reluctantly agrees to leave Earth if Strange undoes the time loop, taking Kaecilius and the zealots with him.
Disgusted by Strange and the Ancient One's disregard for the consequences of defying nature, Mordo departs. Strange returns the Eye, which Wong calls an Infinity Stone, to Kamar-Taj, and then takes up residence in the New York Sanctum to continue his studies.`},
      { char_name: "Peter Quil",
        story_name: "Guardians of the Galaxy",
        plot: `In 1988, following his mother's (Laura Haddock) death (who left him a present just before she died from a long illness), a young Peter Quill (Chris Patt) run outside the hospital in grief. As he lays crying, Peter is abducted from Earth by the Ravagers, a group of space pirates led by Yondu Udonta. Yondu was supposed to deliver Peter for bounty but ends up raising him and has a soft spot for him.
Twenty-six years later on the planet Morag, Quill steals an orb, after which he is intercepted by Korath (Djimon Hounsou), a subordinate to the fanatical Kree, Ronan (Lee Pace). Quill is shown to be listening to old Earth songs on his portal cassette player, which conducting his heists. Peter considers himself to a legendary outlaw by the nickname Star Lord. Although Quill escapes with the Orb, Yondu (Michael Rooker) discovers his theft and issues a bounty for his capture (Yondu was under contract for the Orb, but Quill reached Morag earlier and stole it). Yondu has a whistle-controlled arrow as a weapon that he uses to devastating effect.
Ronan sends the assassin Gamora (Zoe Saldana) after the orb. Assassins Gamora and Nebula are sisters, and adoptive daughters of Thanos. Asked by Thanos, both work for Ronan and have a jealous rivalry. Gamora snatches the orb assignment from Nebula after convincing Ronan that he is making a mistake.
The Kree empire is on the verge of an historic peace treaty with the Nova Empire (& its capital Xandar) and Ronan (who also commands the Kree warship, the Dark Aster) will stop at nothing to prevent that from happening. Ronan wants to avenge the death of his father & forefathers in the 1000 years of war with the Xandarians. Ronan continues to attack Xandarian outposts throughout the Galaxy, and the Kree refuses to restrain him. Irani Rael (Glenn Close) is the head of Nova Corps, known as Nova Prime.
When Quill attempts to sell the orb on the Nova Empire capital world, Xandar, Gamora ambushes him and steals it. A fight ensues, drawing in a pair of bounty hunters looking for Quill: the genetically engineered raccoon Rocket (Bradley Cooper), and the tree-like humanoid Groot (Vin Diesel). The Nova Corps arrives and arrests all four, imprisoning them in the Kyln. While there, a powerful inmate, Drax (Dave Bautista), attempts to kill Gamora due to her association with Ronan, who killed his family. Quill convinces Drax that Gamora can bring Ronan to him. Gamora reveals that she has betrayed Ronan, unwilling to let him use the orb's power to destroy planets, starting with Xandar. Learning that Gamora has a buyer for the orb, she, Quill, Rocket, Groot, and Drax work together to escape from the Kyln. Working together, the group defeats Kyln's security apparatus and gain access to Quill's ship in the hangar. Quill goes back into the prison to get back his cassette player, which had been confiscated by a guard, before returning to the ship to escape.
Elsewhere, Ronan meets with Gamora's adoptive father, Thanos (Josh Brolin), to discuss her betrayal. Thanos had recently lent Gamora & her sister Nebula (Karen Gillan) to Ronan to help acquire the orb. In return Thanos had promised to destroy Xandar.
Accompanied by Drax, Quill's group escapes the Kyln in his ship - the Milano - and flee to Knowhere, a remote criminal outpost in space built in the giant severed-head of a Celestial. A drunken Drax summons Ronan while the rest of the group meet Gamora's contact, the collector Taneleer Tivan (Benicio Del Toro). Tivan opens the orb, revealing an Infinity Stone, an item of immeasurable power that destroys all but the most powerful beings who wield it. The ones who can control the power of the stone have the power to destroy entire civilizations. Suddenly, Tivan's tormented assistant grabs the Stone, triggering an explosion that engulfs Tivan's archive. Gamora suggests taking the Orb to Nova Corps in a hope that they might be able to contain its power.
Ronan arrives and easily defeats Drax, while the others flee by ship, pursued by Ronan's followers and Gamora's sister Nebula. Nebula destroys Gamora's ship, leaving her floating in space, and Ronan's forces capture the orb. Quill contacts Yondu before following Gamora into space, giving her his helmet to survive; Yondu arrives and retrieves the pair. Rocket, Drax, and Groot threaten to attack Yondu's ship to rescue them, but Quill negotiates a truce by convincing Yondu that they can recover the orb from Ronan & sell for a very large profit.
Quill's group agrees that facing Ronan means certain death, but that they cannot let him use the Infinity Stone to destroy the galaxy. On Ronan's flagship, the Dark Aster, Ronan embeds the Stone in his Warhammer, taking its power for himself. He contacts Thanos, threatening to kill him after the destruction of Xandar; hateful of her adopted father, Nebula allies with Ronan. Quill alerts the Nova Corps & asks for their help to stop Ronan.
Near Xandar, the Dark Aster is confronted by the Ravagers, the Nova Corps, and Quill's group, which breaches the Dark Aster. Ronan uses his empowered Warhammer to destroy the Nova Corps fleet. On the Dark Aster, after Gamora defeats Nebula (who escapes), she unlocks Ronan's chambers, but the group finds themselves outmatched by his power until Rocket crashes the Milano through the Dark Aster and into Ronan. The damaged Dark Aster crash-lands on Xandar, with Groot sacrificing himself to shield the group. Ronan emerges from the wreck and prepares to destroy Xandar, but Quill distracts him, allowing Drax and Rocket to destroy Ronan's Warhammer. Quill grabs the freed Stone, and with Gamora, Drax, and Rocket sharing its burden, they use it to destroy Ronan.
In the aftermath, Quill tricks Yondu into taking a container supposedly containing the Stone, then gives the real Stone to the Nova Corps. As the Ravagers leave Xandar, Yondu remarks that it turned out well that they did not deliver Quill to his father per their contract. Quill's group, now known as the Guardians of the Galaxy, have their criminal records expunged, and Quill learns that he is only half-human, his father being part of an ancient, unknown species. Quill finally opens the last present he received from his mother: a cassette tape filled with her favorite songs.
The Guardians leave in the rebuilt Milano along with a sapling cut from Groot.`},
      { char_name: "Thor",
        story_name: "Thor",
        plot: `Three scientists, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) and Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings) are in a 4WD van in New Mexico & see a lightning storm develop and they drive toward it. Jane is convinced that she has the ability to predict the appearance of Einstein Rosen Bridge, or wormholes in other words. The van hits a man inside the maelstrom, and they stop, it is a well-built blond-haired man, semi-conscious.
In 965 AD, on Earth, the Frost Giants visited Norway. They used the Tesseract and its limitless power to try and convert Earth into a frozen wasteland. Asgardians followed with their armies and joined humans in fighting the Frost Giants. A battle in 965 AD between Frost Giants and Asgardians starts on Earth. The Asgardians force the Frost Giants to retreat to their own home world. The Asgard win and take over the Casket of Ancient Winters (which contained the Tesseract) and return to their realm. The speaker is Odin (Anthony Hopkins) talking to his 2 sons, one blonde, the other a more thoughtful dark-haired boy. Odin says both of them are worthy but only one can be king. Odin says that a wise King never seeks war but is always ready for it. Frigga (Rene Russo) is the mother to Thor and Loki.
Years later Asgard is celebrating, the blonde is now the adult Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and he's becoming crown prince. His brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is jealous. Before Odin can announce, there are intruders in the secure rooms that hold the Frost Giant power casket. A large Destroyer robot kills the intruders and saves the day. Examining the remains Odin seems unperturbed, yet Thor is angry and wants to attack the Frost Giants. Odin orders Thor to stand down and says that he is not the King yet.
Thor gathers Loki and his friends, Volstag (Ray Stevenson), Fandral (Josh Dallas), Hogun (Tadanobu Asano) and Sif (Jaimie Alexander) and are transported to the frost giant planet, Jotunheim. Heimdall allows Thor and his friends to pass as even he wants to know how the Frost Giants got past him to enter Asgard. King Laufey (Colm Feore) taunts the Asgardian heroes, and a battle starts. Loki survives as Frost can't touch him and his skin turns blue just as the skin color of the other Frost Giants. Laufey releases a huge beast and the Asgard run for their lives. Odin arrives to save the day, he apologizes to Laufey and takes the group home.
Odin is angry at Thor & banishes him to Earth & strips him of his power. He also sends his hammer Mjolnir saying only worthy can use it. Back in desert Thor is aggressive & Darcy tasers him & takes him to hospital. Jane is attracted to him. Thor escapes from the hospital, but Jane again catches up with him & take him with her. Thor is looking for his hammer & follows the reports of a satellite crash 50 miles away. Jane had all the data that suggests Thor traveled through a wormhole to arrive on Earth, but Agent Colsen arrives and takes all her equipment away.
The Hammer is already under Government protection who also take Janes research notes. Thor attacks at night but is subdued when he can't lift the hammer. Back in Asgard the 3 friends suspect Loki had something to do with Thor's banishment. Loki realizes he is not a pure Asgard and Odin had admitted he was taken from Jotunheim as an infant and raised as his own. Loki is confused and angry as Odin falls into a coma ("Odinsleep") upon being confronted. Loki becomes acting King.
Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) questions Thor. Loki appears & tells Thor that Odin is dead & he can't be brought back to Asgard. Erik tells Coulson that Thor is Jane's ex-husband & he is let go. Thor & Erik have a drink & Erik passes out. Thor explains his background to Jane. Loki freezes the portal guard Heimdall (Idris Elba) (The all-seeing, all-hearing Asgardian sentry of the Bifrost bridge) then goes and meets Laufey. It was Loki that allowed the Frost Giants into Asgard to go for the power casket earlier. He makes a deal with Laufey that he will let them into Asgard again to kill Odin and have their casket, in return they will go home in peace.
Loki commands the Destroyer to go to earth and kill Thor. The giant robot arrives in the NM desert and starts blasting everything with a heat ray. Thor and the three scientists attempt to get everyone away safely. Thor confronts the Destroyer and asks Loki to leave the humans alone in return for himself. Loki can see and hear what is going on from Asgard. The Destroyer gives Thor a vicious backhand slap and sends him tumbling, apparently dead. Jane runs to the body in tears. However, Thor's selfless act in protecting his friends proves him worthy to once again wield Mjolnir, which frees itself from the crater and returns to Thor's hand. He is transformed to full life and vigor and once again fitted in his red cape and armor. He easily defeats the Destroyer and tries to return to Asgard, promising Jane he will return.
In Asgard the frost giants invade through the portal, walking past the frozen guard. Laufey goes to Odin's bed chamber and, as he prepares to kill the Norse god, Loki kills Laufey to appear to be the hero. Although frozen Heimdall is conscious and manages to break free. He brings Thor back to Asgard. Thor flies quickly to fight the Frost giants.
Loki goes to the Bifrost Portal and sets it up to destroy the ice planet realm. Thor tries to stop him and the two engage in combat. Thor immobilizes Loki with Mjolnir and starts to destroy the portal to stop the process. As everything crumbles the two brothers fall into space but Odin is there to hold Thor who holds Loki's staff. Loki admits defeat and allows himself to fall into the disappearing Bifrost Bridge.
All seems back to normal on Asgard, Odin is sad how it all turned out, Thor pines for Jane but Heimdall assures him she is looking for him. Back on Earth Jane is in a new lab with new equipment.`},
      { char_name: "Tony Stark",
        story_name: "Iron Man",
        plot: `Playboy and genius Tony Stark (Robert Downing Jr) has inherited the defense contractor Stark Industries from his father the legendary Howard Stark. Tony was brilliant from the beginning and built his first circuit board when he was 4 years old, his first engine at the age of 6, graduated from MIT at 17. Howard died in a car accident soon thereafter. Obadiah Stane took over the company till Tony returned to take over at the age of 21. Tony has subsequently unleashed an array of smart weapons that have changed the face of conflict forever.
Journalist Christine Everhart confronts Tony in Vegas and presents evidence that his company is selling weapons to terrorists and are being used to subjugate native defenseless populations across the globe. Tony has sex with Christine. Pepper Potts is Tony's personal assistant. Harold "Happy" Hogan (Jon Favreau) is Stark's bodyguard and chauffeur. J.A.R.V.I.S. (Paul Bettany) is Stark's personal AI system.
Tony is in war-torn Afghanistan with his friend and military liaison, Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes (Terrence Howard) to demonstrate the new "Jericho" missile. Rhodes and Tony are very good friends. The Jericho missile incorporates the new "Repulsor" technology and can deliver explosive payloads to multiple targets with a single missile, over a relatively large combat area.
Stark is critically wounded in an ambush (where he notices that terrorists have access to weapons manufactured by his own company) and imprisoned in a cave by the terrorist group the Ten Rings. An electromagnet (powered by a heavy car battery) built by fellow captive Yinsen (Shaun Toub) keeps the shrapnel that wounded Stark from reaching his heart and killing him. Ten Rings leader Raza (Faran Tahir) offers Stark freedom in exchange for building a Jericho missile for the group, but Tony and Yinsen agree Raza will not keep his word. Yinsen tells Tony that his weapons in the hands of terrorists is his legacy to the world.
Tony and Yinsen use the components from other missiles (also manufactured by Stark Industries) and extract Palladium (a precious metal) from it. They use the limited forge facilities available to them and work meticulously. Stark and Yinsen secretly build a powerful electric generator called an arc reactor (Tony had a large Arc reactor back home powering his factory and he has built a miniaturized version of it), to power Stark's electromagnet (instead of the bulky battery), and then begin to build a suit of armor to escape. The suit is a very basic design, heavy and bulky. It has rudimentary weapons, a flame thrower, and rocket Thrusters at the base to launch the occupant into flight. With the arc reactor, it can be powered for about 15 minutes.
The Ten Rings attack the workshop when they discover what Stark is doing. Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while Stark's suit powers up. The armored Stark battles his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then an enraged Stark burns the terrorist's munitions and flies away, only to crash in the desert, destroying the suit.
After being rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home and announces that his company will no longer manufacture weapons. Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), his father's old partner and the company's manager, advises Stark that this may ruin Stark Industries and his father's legacy. Tony reveals to Stane that he has built a new miniaturized Arc reactor. The reactor has the power to provide clean energy to the entire planet.
In his home workshop, Stark builds an improved version of his suit, as well as a more powerful arc reactor for his chest. Personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) places the original reactor inside a small glass showcase. Though Stane requests details on his work, a suspicious Stark decides to keep his work to himself.
At Stark's first public appearance after his return, reporter Christine Everhart (Leslie Bibb) informs him that Stark Industries weapons, including the Jericho, were recently delivered to the Ten Rings and are being used to attack Yinsen's home village. Stark also learns that Stane is trying to replace him as head of the company. Enraged, Stark dons his new armor and flies to Afghanistan, where he saves Yinsen's village and delivers a devastating blow to the Ten Rings. While flying home, Stark is shot at by two F-22 Raptor fighter jets. He phones Rhodes and reveals his secret identity in an attempt to end the attack.
Meanwhile, the Ten Rings gather the pieces of Stark's prototype suit and meet with Stane, who subdues Raza and has the rest of the group eliminated. Stane has a new suit reverse engineered from the wreckage. Seeking to find any other weapons delivered to the Ten Rings, Stark sends assistant Virginia "Pepper" Potts to hack into the company computer system from Stane's office. She discovers Stane has been supplying the terrorists and hired the Ten Rings to kill Stark, but the group reneged. Potts later meets with agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) of the "Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division", a counter-terrorism agency, to inform him of Stane's activities.
Stane's scientists cannot duplicate Stark's arc reactor, so Stane ambushes Stark at home, using a sonic device to paralyze him and take his arc reactor. Left to die, Stark manages to crawl to his lab and plug in his original reactor. Potts and several S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division) agents attempt to arrest Stane, but he dons his suit and attacks them. Stark fights Stane but is over-matched without his new reactor to run his suit at full capacity. Stark lures Stane atop the Stark Industries building and instructs Potts to overload the large arc reactor there. This unleashes a massive electrical surge that knocks Stane unconscious, causing him and his armor to fall into the exploding reactor, killing him.
The next day, the press has dubbed the armored hero "Iron Man". Agent Coulson gives Stark a cover story to explain the events of the night and Stane's death. At a press conference, Stark begins giving the cover story, but then announces that he is Iron Man, prompting the reporters to ask more questions.`},
      { char_name: "Steve Rogers", 
        story_name: "Captain America",
        plot: `Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving), a high-ranking Nazi, in search of a glass cube (the Tesseract). Jonhann is the top-ranking scientist in Nazi Germany, working on superpowers from the Occult. He finds the Tesseract in Norway. In New York, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is a thin asthmatic found ineligible for US military service. He friend James "Bucky" Barnes has been accepted & is accepted to 107th infantry.
Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) notices Steve, & his determination despite his appearance. He is also on the recruitment board & accepts Steve when he applies next. Meanwhile Johann works with Arnim Zola to harness the power of the cube to create energy weapons. They are both part of Hydra which earlier operated under Nazi, but to grow further Johann terminates his association to Hitler & goes independent.
Erskine takes Steve for basic training under Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones). Chester is supervising Erskine's super soldier program. Peggy Carter (Haley Atwell) is a British Officer on the platoon. Despite being smallest & weakest, Steve impresses all with his spirit and selflessness. Erskine reveals to Steve that he worked with Johann earlier to create a serum that gives man superhuman strength. When Erskine used it on Johann it backfired & left him as a sinewy red skeleton. Thats when Erskine had to flee & join the US. Erskine performs the procedure on Steve instantly transforming him into a super soldier.
A Nazi spy kills Erskine & steals the last serum & escapes. Steve runs after the perpetrator & captures him, but the perpetrator swallows the vial of cyanide & kills himself. He has a tattoo of Hydra on himself. As Chester & Peggy conduct their investigation, Steve is enlisted by a Senator to raise funds for the bond as a comic superhero Captain America.
He is taken overseas where he meets Chester & Peggy & finds that the 107th has been captured by Hydra. Eager to save Bucky, Steve wants to go in. Howard is a private defense contractor and friend of Peggy. When Chester refuses to help Steve, Howard air drops Steve behind enemy lines & near Hydra's weapons plant.
Steve comes face to face with Johann & sees his red skull face. Johann escapes with Arnim, & Steve destroys the base & finds a map with the location of rest of Hydra's bases. He rescues Bucky & 500 other men of the 107th. They return with the recovered weapons, much to the astonishment of Chester.
Chester offers help to Steve to pursue Johann, but Steve prefers the same team & the rescued prisoners who helped him in their first attack on Hydra. Howard gives Steve a shield made of Vibranium. Lighter than steel & the strongest metal on earth. Peggy is attracted to Steve but finds him kissing another GI & is angry.
Steve manages to destroy many bases of Hydra & even captures Arnim on his journey through the Swiss Alps. But Bucky dies in that operation. Arnim reveals the location of Hydra's last base. Steve goes headfirst into the base & is captured & brought in front of Johann. The rest of the team attacks with surprise.
Johann has created a plane & stacked it with super bombs with the name of each major city in US. He takes off. Steve pursues & kisses Peggy before he jumps on the plane. The plane is powered by the cube. Steve destroys the cube console. As the cube escapes, it opens a space portal & Johann is swept into it & disintegrated. Steve realizes that the plane is on auto pilot. He radios Peggy & begs his forgiveness & dives the plane into the ocean.
Steve awakens in a 1940's hospital. An old-fashioned radio transmits the play-by-play of a Dodger game. He gets up, looks out the windows and watches as the hospital door opens. A young woman (Amanda Righetti) who bears a striking resemblance to Peggy enters. She waits for a response from Steve, who suspiciously looks at her. He asks why the radio is playing a Mets game from May 1941... a game that he was at. She reaches into her pocket and withdraws a Walky-Talky. Two tall soldiers in black uniforms enter the room, and Steve easily tosses them through a wall. Steve steps through the hole and is surprised to see that he was on a movie-set. He runs through the dark corridors, pushes a door open and appears in a modern skyscraper, bustling with people in business suits. He flees the building and finds himself in 2011's Time Square. He peers around, shocked by his surroundings, and watches as numerous matching black SUVs encircle him.
Nicky Fury (Samuel L Jackson) steps out and carefully speaks to Steve. He tells him that he's been asleep, in ice, for 70 years. The hospital set was meant to gradually introduce him to modern society. Still perplexed, Steve breathes heavily and sadly tells Fury that he had a date. `},
      { char_name: "Scott Lang", 
        story_name: "Ant Man",
        plot: `In 1989, scientist Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) resigns from S.H.I.E.L.D. (led by Howard (John Slattery) and Peggy (Hayley Atwell)) after discovering their attempt to replicate his Ant-Man shrinking technology. Believing the technology is dangerous, Pym vows to hide it as long as he lives. Mitchell Carson wanted to force Hank to surrender the technology but is stopped by Howard and Peggy. Pym had developed the Pym particle which reduces the distance between atoms while increasing density and strength.
In the present day, Pym's estranged daughter, Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), and former protege, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), have forced him out of his company, Pym Technologies. Cross is close to perfecting a shrinking suit of his own, the Yellowjacket, which horrifies Pym. The Yellowjacket is a highly weapon laden version of his own shrinking suit and can have devastating consequences, if put into production. Unknown to Darren, Hope is spying for Pym and wants Pym to give her his original suit to defeat Darren. But Pym steadily refuses to do that & asks Hope to consider his suggested alternative. However, Darren is having difficulty in achieving a stable molecular reduction, leading to his organic test subjects being reduced to a gooey mass of cells. Eventually, he succeeds.
Upon his release from prison, well-meaning thief Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) moves in with his old cellmate, Luis (Michael Pena). Luis's roommates are Kurt (David Dastmalchian), who is a computer wizard & Dave (Tip "T.I." Harris) a pro lock smith. Lang has a master's in electrical engineering and yet cannot land a job due to his past record and has to serve at a Baskin Robbins. While visiting his daughter Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson) unannounced, Lang is rebuked by his former wife Maggie (Judy Greer) and her police-detective fiance, Paxton (Bobby Cannavale), for not providing child support. Maggie asks Lang to get an apartment and to pay child support before he is allowed his visitation rights with Cassie.
Unable to hold a job because of his criminal record (Lang lies about his past to get the job but is fired whenever his background check is completed), Lang agrees to join Luis' crew and commit a burglary. Lang breaks into a house and cracks its safe, but only finds what he believes to be an old motorcycle suit, which he takes home. Unknown to Lang, the entire burglary was being observed by an ant with a micro-camera on it, which was relaying a live feed to Pym. After trying the suit on, Lang accidentally shrinks himself to the size of an insect. Terrified by the experience (during which Pym speaks to Lang via his helmet), he returns the suit to the house, but is arrested on the way out. Pym, the homeowner, visits Lang in jail and smuggles the suit into his cell to help him break out with the assistance of ants and flying insects.
At his home, Pym, who manipulated Lang through an unknowing Luis into stealing the suit as a test, wants Lang to become the new Ant-Man to steal the Yellowjacket from Cross. Pym says that he generates Electro-magnetic waves to stimulate the ant's olfactory nerves and is thus able to speak to them and get them to obey his commands.
Hope still believes that she can defeat Darren, but Pym is afraid to lose her as he did her mother. Pym explains to Lang that he designed a formula 40 years ago to shrink humans inside his suit. But he hid the formula as it was dangerous. He started his own company, Pym tech, & took Darren on as his protege. With time Darren suspected the existence of Pym's formula. When Pym did not cooperate with Darre, he voted Pym out of his own company.
Hope was angry with Pym for the death of her mother & helped Darren. But then she came back to Pym when she saw that Darren was loco. Pym's plan is to train Lang to use the suit & to break into Darren's lab, steal his suit & destroy all the data. Pym says that his specially designed helmet helps protect the brain chemistry, something that Darren has ignored in the design of his suit.
Having been spying on Cross after discovering his intentions, Hope helps Pym train Lang to fight in the suit and to control ants. While Hope harbors resentment towards Pym about her mother Janet's (Hayley Lovitt) death, he reveals that Janet, known as the Wasp, disappeared into a subatomic quantum realm to disable a Soviet nuclear missile (it was headed for the US and the only way to disable it was to go subatomic through solid titanium. Pym's own regulator was damaged, and so Janet stepped up). Pym warns Lang that he could suffer a similar fate if he overrides his suit's regulator. They send him to steal a device that will aid their heist from the Avengers' headquarters, where he briefly fights Sam Wilson/Falcon (Anthony Mackie).
Cross perfects the Yellowjacket and hosts an unveiling ceremony at Pym Technologies' headquarters. Lang, along with his crew and a swarm of flying ants, infiltrates the building during the event, sabotages the company's servers, and plants explosives. When he attempts to steal the Yellowjacket, he, along with Pym and Hope, are captured by Cross, who intends to sell both the Yellowjacket and Ant-Man suits to Hydra, led by former S.H.I.E.L.D officer Mitchell Carson (Martin Donovan). Lang breaks free and he and Hope dispatch most of the Hydra agents, though Carson is able to flee with a vial of Cross' particles. Lang pursues Cross as he escapes, while the explosives detonate, imploding the building.
Cross dons the Yellowjacket and attacks Lang before Lang is arrested by Paxton. His mind addled by the imperfect shrinking technology, Cross takes Cassie hostage to lure Lang into another fight. Lang overrides the regulator and shrinks to subatomic size to penetrate Cross' suit and sabotage it to shrink uncontrollably, killing Cross. Lang disappears into the quantum realm but manages to reverse the effects and returns to the macroscopic world.
In gratitude for Lang's heroism, Paxton covers for Lang to keep him out of prison. Seeing that Lang survived and returned from the quantum realm, Pym wonders if his wife is alive as well. Later, Lang meets up with Luis, who tells him that Wilson is looking for him.`},
      { char_name: "Peter Parker",
        story_name: "Spider Man",
        plot: `Following the Battle of New York, Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) and his salvage company are contracted to clean up the city, but their operation is taken over by the Department of Damage Control (D.O.D.C.), a partnership between Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and the U.S. government headed by Anne Marie Hoag (Tyne Daly). This puts Toomes out of commission as he loses the contract. Toomes had invested a large amount of money in the business. Enraged at being driven out of business, Toomes persuades his employees to keep the Chitauri technology they have already scavenged and use it to create and sell advanced weapons. Among the salvaged materials are power sources for the alien weapons, which Toomes figures out to use in new and advanced Earth weapons.
Eight years later, Toomes has a thriving illegal weapons business based on the Chitauri technology. Toomes has designed a flying, armored suit for himself, which he uses to salvage for more alien parts. Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is drafted into the Avengers by Stark to help with an internal dispute (in the events of Civil War). After the events in Berlin, Peter resumes his studies at the Midtown School of Science and Technology, while he waits for a formal invitation from Stark to join the Avengers initiative. 2 months later Stark tells him he is not yet ready to become a full Avenger. May Parker (Marisa Tomei) is Peter's aunt. Harold "Happy" Hogan (Jon Favreau) is Stark's head of security and it "looking after" Parker.
Parker quits his school's academic decathlon team to spend more time focusing on his crime-fighting activities as Spider-Man. Parker has a crush on Liz, who is on the Decathlon team, while school tomboy Michelle believes Peter is a loser for spying on Liz. One night, after preventing criminals from robbing an ATM with their advanced weapons from Toomes, Parker returns to his Queens apartment where his best friend Ned (Jacob Batalon) discovers his secret identity. Peter informs Happy about criminals he encountered with advanced alien weapons, but Happy dismisses it as petty crime and tells Peter to stay away from crime fighting. Happy also informs Peter that Stark sold the Stark tower and the whole Avengers team is moving upstate.
On another night, Peter notices big blasts happening at a distance and goes to investigate. Parker comes across Toomes' associates Jackson Brice / Shocker (Logan Marshall-Green) and Herman Schultz (Bokeem Woodbine) selling weapons to local criminal Aaron Davis (Donald Glover). Parker saves Davis, and then pursues those criminals across the city. Toomes arrives on his winged suit, after being alerted by Herman. Peter is caught by Toomes and dropped in a lake, nearly drowning after becoming tangled in a parachute built into his suit. He is rescued by Stark, who is monitoring the Spider-Man suit he gave Parker and warns him against further involvement with the criminals. Stark was speaking to Peter via a drone suit. After the drone suit leaves, Peter finds the alien technology weapons nearby.
Toomes is mad at Brice for firing the weapons in the open, but Brice simply doesn't care. Toomes threatens to fire Brice, but Brice says that he can expose Toomes and his entire illegal weapons operation to the DODC and to the Avengers. Toomes accidentally kills Brice with one of their weapons, and Schultz becomes the new Shocker.
Parker and Ned study the weapon left behind by Brice, removing its power core. Parker finds that Schultz has tracked the weapon to his school, where Ned and he were conducting experiments on it. Peter follows Schultz and puts a tracking device on his. When a tracking device on Schultz leads to Maryland, Parker rejoins the decathlon team and accompanies them to Washington, D.C. for their national tournament. Ned and Parker disable the tracker Stark implanted in the Spider-Man suit and unlock its advanced features.
Peter tracks down Schultz and finds that he is tracking a DODC truck for Toomes. Parker tries to stop Toomes from stealing weapons from a D.O.D.C. truck, but is trapped inside the truck, causing him to miss the decathlon tournament. When he discovers that the power core is an unstable Chitauri grenade (which Ned has been carrying in his back pack ever since they experimented on the weapon in school), Parker races to the Washington Monument where the core explodes (the core was activated after it passes through an x-ray scanning machine) and traps Ned and their friends in an elevator. Evading local authorities, Parker saves his friends, including his fellow classmate and crush Liz (Laura Harrier). Peter's future girlfriend Michelle "MJ" Jones (Zendaya) is also part of the academic decathlon team that Peter joined in order to get to DC.
Returning to New York City, Parker analyzes his video (recorded by his suit) and identifies Davis. Peter believes that apprehending the criminals will surely get Stark to invite Peter to the Avengers and he wants that at all costs. Peter tracks & persuades Davis to reveal Toomes' whereabouts. Aboard the Staten Island Ferry, Parker captures Toomes' new buyer Mac Gargan (Michael Mando), but Toomes escapes, and a malfunctioning weapon tears the ferry in half. Stark helps Parker save the passengers before admonishing him for his recklessness and taking away his suit.
Parker returns to his high school life, and eventually asks Liz to go to the homecoming dance with him. On the night of the dance, Parker learns that Liz is Toomes' daughter. Deducing Parker's secret identity, Toomes threatens retaliation if he interferes with his plans. During the dance, Parker realizes Toomes is planning to hijack a D.O.D.C. plane transporting weapons from Avengers Tower to the team's new headquarters. He dons his old homemade Spider-Man suit and races to Toomes' lair. He is first ambushed by Schultz but defeats him with the help of Ned.
At the lair, Toomes destroys the building's support beams and leaves Parker to die. Parker escapes the rubble and intercepts the plane, steering it to crash on the beach near Coney Island. He and Toomes continue fighting, ending with Parker saving Toomes' life after some unstable material explodes, and leaving him for the police along with the plane's cargo. After her father's arrest, Liz moves away, and Parker declines an invitation from Stark to join the Avengers full-time. Stark returns Parker's suit, which he puts on at his apartment just as his Aunt May walks in.`},
      { char_name: "Natasha Romanoff", 
        story_name: "Black Widow",
        plot: `In 1995, super soldier Alexei Shostakov (David Harbour) (The Russian super-soldier counterpart to Captain America and a father-figure to Romanoff and Belova) and Black Widow Melina Vostokoff (Rachel Weisz) (A seasoned spy trained in the Red Room as a Black Widow and a mother-figure to Romanoff and Belova who is now one of the Red Room's lead scientists) work as Russian undercover agents, posing as a family in Ohio with Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) as their daughters.
They steal S.H.I.E.L.D. intel and escape to Cuba where their boss, General Dreykov (Ray Winstone) (Russian General and head of the Red Room Program), has Romanoff and Belova taken to the Red Room for training. Yelena is happy to be back, but Natasha is distraught at leaving Ohio and doesn't want to go back into the Red Room program. Years pass, during which Shostakov is imprisoned in Russia while Romanoff defects to S.H.I.E.L.D. after bombing Dreykov's Budapest office and apparently killing him and his young daughter Antonia (Olga Kurylenko).
In 2016, Romanoff is a fugitive for violating the Sokovia Accords (The Sokovia Accords are a set of legal documents designed to regulate the activities of enhanced individuals, specifically for those who work for either government agencies such as S.H.I.E.L.D. or for private organizations such as the Avengers. Established by the United Nations and ratified by 117 nations, the accords serve as a "middle point" between the Avengers' desire to secure world peace and the international community's concern over the repercussions of the Avengers' actions).
The Sokovia Accords caused a schism in the Avengers. While Tony Stark supported the Accords due to his role in the Ultron Offensive, Steve Rogers recognized that the government having power over potential missions may be a terrible idea in an emergency and disliked the authoritarian nature of its stipulations, noting that signing the Accords would be "surrendering the right to choose". The schism came to a head when Helmut Zemo framed Bucky Barnes for a terrorist attack that occurred during the signing of the Accords.
Combined with Zemo's exploitation of the schism, the Accords tore the Avengers apart, causing Stark's pro-Accords faction and Rogers' anti-Accords faction to destroy an airport as the former attempted to arrest the latter. The Accords caused the anti-Accords faction and Natasha Romanoff, who had been pro-Accords but betrayed Stark's faction knowing that Rogers would never stand down, to either become fugitives or be placed under house arrest, ruining any chance of coordinated defense.
She escapes from U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) and flees to a safe-house in Norway supplied by Rick Mason (O-T Fagbenle) (An ally from Romanoff's S.H.I.E.L.D. past who is romantically interested in her). Meanwhile, Belova kills a rogue former Black Widow but comes in contact with a synthetic gas that neutralizes the Red Room's chemical mind-control agent. Belova removes her own tracker, sends antidote vials to Romanoff, hoping she and the Avengers can free the other Widows, and goes into hiding.
When Romanoff is unknowingly driving with the vials in her car, Red Room agent Taskmaster attacks her. Romanoff realizes that the Taskmaster is interested in a case, and escapes from Taskmaster and finds that the vials came from Belova (it was collected by Mason from Natasha's hideout in Budapest). There she finds Belova who reveals that Dreykov is alive, and the Red Room is still active. Black Widows and Taskmaster attack them, but Romanoff and Belova evade them and meet with Mason, who supplies them with a helicopter. Belova says that the antidote was created by a Black Widow from Melina's generation. Belova says Dreykov has killed many little girls (only 1 in 20 survives the training, the rest he kills), and the black widow program needs to stop.
Romanoff and Belova break Shostakov out of prison (he was imprisoned by Dreykov, but he doesn't know why) to learn Dreykov's location, and he directs them to Vostokoff who lives on a farm outside Saint Petersburg. There she is refining the chemical mind control process used on the Widows (This is what Shostakov and Melina has stolen from SHEILD in the first place, all those yrs ago). Belova tells Melina that her mind control chemicals were used on her, and she only managed to get out because of the antidote, while Natasha abandoned her. Melina also tells Natasha that she was not abandoned by her parents, she was selected by a program that assessed genetic potential in infants, and her parents were paid off. But her mom kept looking for her, threatening the exposure of the Red room, so Dreykov had her killed
Vostokoff alerts Dreykov and his agents arrive to take them, but Romanoff convinces Vostokoff to help them (by informing her how her mind control research has been used to kill and maim Soviet girls all over the world) and the pair use face mask technology to switch places. The Taskmaster arrives, everyone is sedated and taken to the Red room, which is a floating city in the sky.
At the Red Room, Vostokoff frees Shostakov and Belova from their restraints. Dreykov sees through Romanoff's disguise and reveals that Taskmaster is Antonia, who suffered damage severe enough that Dreykov had to put technology in her head to save her, in turn creating the perfect soldier, capable of mimicking the actions & fighting styles of anyone she sees. Romanoff is unable to attack Dreykov due to a pheromone lock installed in every Widow but negates that by breaking her own nose and severing a nerve in her nasal passage. Shostakov battles Taskmaster while Vostokoff takes out one of the facility's engines. They then lock Taskmaster in a cell.
Dreykov escapes as other Black Widows attack Romanoff, but Belova exposes them to the antidote. Romanoff copies the locations of other Widows worldwide from Dreykov's computer as the facility begins to explode and fall. She retrieves two surviving antidote vials and frees Taskmaster from the locked cell.
Vostokoff and Shostakov escape via a plane (which loses control after they lose their vertical stabilizer and hence, they can't get back to the red room to rescue the girls) while Belova takes out Dreykov's aircraft (by destroying its engine with a pole, by the explosion throws her off the exploding deck of the Red room), killing him. Romanoff, who was watching this, jumps after her. In free-fall, Romanoff gives Belova a parachute before battling Taskmaster. After landing, Romanoff uses one antidote vial on Taskmaster and gives the other to Belova along with the locations of the other mind-controlled Widows so she can find and free them. Belova, Vostokoff, and Shostakov say goodbye to Romanoff and leave with Antonia and the freed Widows. Two weeks later, Mason supplies Romanoff with a Quinjet to use in freeing the imprisoned Avengers.`},
